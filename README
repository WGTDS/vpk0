Preface:

    From: "Pokémon Snap (USA)"
          and
          "NINTENDO Game Boy Advance SDK 3.0/bin/agbcomp.exe"
          and
          "nvpktool_src/nvpktool.cpp"

    "vpk0" decoding functionality was recovered through the act
    of decompiling the Nintendo 64 title, "Pokémon Snap",
    using "Ghidra", a reverse software engineering suite.

    Lempel-Ziv encoding functionality was based upon the routine
    recovered from "agbcomp.exe" using the aforementioned tool,
    "Ghidra", in addition to, "Snowman", an x86 decompiler.

    The bit-stream routine used in the encoding process draws
    significant reference from "nvpktool" by "CaitSith2",
    however, customizable functionality present in their
    source code will not be implemented as it is not within
    the scope for the goal of this project.

Description:

    This is a tool that handles HAL's "vpk0" data format.

    It's still a work in progress, however, it is a
    functional program.

    * Can decode vpk0 data; both type 0x00 and type 0x01.
    * Encodes data to a bit-stream LZ format that's supported
      by the decoding routine.

Motive:

    Nearly 20 years ago, an individual under the alias "CaitSith2"
    successfully reverse-engineered the vpk0 format used by the
    Nintendo e-Reader for the Game Boy Advance.

    This development is certainly no small feat, however, some
    individuals are curious as to whether or not they themselves
    can <fully> reverse-engineer the format focusing on 1:1 accuracy.

    As of February 2022, only the LZ portion of the format has
    been replicated. The Huffman format has yet to be cracked.
