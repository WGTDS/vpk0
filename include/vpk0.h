    HALKEN vpk0 Tool ( Work in Progress ) v0.75

    This is a data compression tool presented with the goal of
    *faithfully reverse-engineering the compression aspect of
    HAL Laboratory's enigmatic algorithm.
    It supports decompression by using the code found within
    one of their Nintendo 64 titles, Pok√©mon Snap.

    As of present, the compression portion is at 50% with the LZ
    routine being faithfully deduced (I hope).

    The exact Huffman routine has yet to be unraveled, therefore,
    this tool temporarily uses bit-stream LZ encoding.

    *This project yields inspiration from CaitSith2 in a number
    of ways, however, the key motive for this project is to
    replicate the format, _faithfully_ (i.e. 1:1 encoded data).

/*------------------------------------------------------
At the expense of RAM, adjusting this macro value
will improve execution time during encoding by reducing
the frequency of re-allocation calls with the work
buffer(s) in use, in addition to, increasing the
possibility of errors concerning integer overflows or
allocation rejection.
The aforementioned macro corresponds to the number of
bits that will be left-shifted by a hard-coded value
as part of an incremental supplement in conjunction
with work RAM buffers used for storing encoded data
representation elements.
