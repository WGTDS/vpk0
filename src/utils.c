    HALKEN vpk0 Tool ( Work in Progress ) v0.75.1

    This is a data compression tool presented with the goal of
    *faithfully reverse-engineering the compression aspect of
    HAL Laboratory's enigmatic algorithm.
    It supports decompression by using the code found within
    one of their Nintendo 64 titles, Pok√©mon Snap.

    As of present, the compression portion is at 50% with the LZ
    routine being faithfully deduced (I hope).

    The exact Huffman routine has yet to be unraveled, therefore,
    this tool temporarily uses bit-stream LZ encoding.

    *This project yields inspiration from CaitSith2 in a number
    of ways, however, the key motive for this project is to
    replicate the format, _faithfully_ (i.e. 1:1 encoded data).
